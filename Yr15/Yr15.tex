%This section describes in detail than the paper of \citet{Ramirez-Gonzalez-2014}
 
%Breeding importance of \textit{Yr15} and original source (an introgression of \textit{T. diccocoides}). 
Wheat breeding programs aim to improve the wheat lines available for production.
One way to facilitate the selection of elite lines is to find molecular markers that can facilitate the selection of seeds without having to wait until the phenotype is observed.   
Bulk Segregant Analysis (BSA) consists on pooling the DNA of individuals with contrasting phenotypes \citep{Michelmore1991} on a segregating population. 
The bulks show as heterozygous except for the region that is linked to the trait of interest. 
This approach can be used to identify SNPs using High Throughput Sequencing, such as: exome capture \citep{Hodges2007}, RNA-Seq \citep{Pickrell2010}, whole genome resquencing \citep{Schneeberger2009}, among others. 

One of the traits desired in an elite line is the resistance to pathogens, such as \textit{Puccinia striiformis} f. sp.  \textit{tritici}, the fungi responsible of yellow rust.
A source of resistance genes is are introgressions from other species, suchas \textit{Triticum diccocides}. 
In the University of Sydney a collection of Near Isogenic Lines (NILs) with introgressions to several Yellow Rust resistance genes on a susceptible background were developed \citep{Wellings1998}. 
On this chapter the NIL for the \textit{Yr15} locus is used to produce a mapping population to improve diagnostic markers. 
The population was sequenced using RNA-Seq and a bioinformatic pipeline was developed to score Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to the \textit{Yr15} locus.  
Finally, the best candidate SNPs where selected to produce a genetic map which lead to a triplet of markers diagnostic to the target locus. The steps described in this chapter were first published in \citet{Ramirez-Gonzalez2015c} and the results of this chapter are published in \citet{Ramirez-Gonzalez2015b}.

The population was developed by crossing the resistant line `Avocet + \textit{Yr15}` (\textit{Yr15}) \citep{Wellings1998}, Figure \ref{fig:yr15.yr15Photo}, to the susceptible line Avocet (AVS), Figure \ref{fig:yr15:avsPhoto}. 
$F_{2}$ seeds from tree independent $F_{1}$ plants where sown and tissue was collected, before the fungal inoculation to avoid the effect of the response on the gene expression.  
The plants were challenged at the three leaf stage as it is know that \textit{Yr15} confers resistance in seedlings \citep{Gerechter-Amitai1989}.
The expected segregation on an $F_{2}$ population is 3:1 (resistant:susceptible), since \textit{Yr15} is a dominant gene.
From the 232 plants in the $F_{2}$ population that germinated, 187 were resistant and 45 were susceptible, which deviates slightly from the expected ratio ($\chi^{2}=0.049$).
Segregation distortion has been shown for the same \textit{Yr15} donnor \citep{Randhawa2009}, however the decresed number of succeptible plants can be explained by escapes in the virulence essays (i.e. plants scored as resistant without the \textit{Yr15} locus).   For this study we extracted DNA from individual plants in the $F_{2}$ population and we bulked RNA on 6 different bulks: 3 resistant and, 3 succeptible, Figure \ref{fig:yr15:f2}. 

\section{Sequencing and mapping} 

RNA-Seq was used to avoid sequencing the non-coding regions and reduce the search space.  
The sequencing of the bulks and the parents were done on a single Illumina Hi-Seq2000 each.
The bulks were multiplexed and sequenced on a third of a lane each, as shown on Table \ref{tab:yr15:reads}. 
To ensure that the quality of the sequencencing was good, \verb|fastqc-0.10| \citep{fastqc}  was run with its default parameters in each one of the fastq files.  
The GC content was around 52\% in all the samples (Appendx \ref{App:AppendixQCGC}), which is expected as the sample should be of coding regions, and for wheat the reported GC content in genes is around 55\%.  
The quality of the reads is fairly consistent, in general dropping after the base 80 across the samples (Appendix \ref{App:AppendixQCRead}).

When the analysis was started, the draft genome and the corresponding annotation where not not release yet, hence gene models where used. 
All the samples where aligned to the Unigenes v60 (56,954 genes) and the gene models from UCW \citep{Krasileva2013} using \verb|BWA 0.5.9| \citep{Li2009}. 
The alignment provided showed that a few genes were overly expressed, however we still have have 22,107 and 36,808 genes, on the Unigenes and the UCW gene set respectivley,  with a coverage greater than 20x in the progenitor with \textit{Yr15}, Supplemental Table \ref{app:seqAlnCov}. 
Both gene sets performed similarly in terms of the percentage of genes with reads and percentage of aligned reads. 
Since each individual bulk has a lower coverage, the susceptible and resistant reads were merged \textit{in silico} and mapped as the individual bulks.

\section{Conclusions} 
Remarks on how this techinque can be used to do fine-mapping and that if I were to start the project now I would  use exome capture or Ren-Seq. 

The references have changed since we started
we can use different techniques now (exome capture, ren-seq)
The markers are now used by our collaborators.
