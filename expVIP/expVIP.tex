\chapter[expVIP]{expVIP: a customisable RNA-seq data analysis and visualisation platform.}
\label{cha:exp}



The software developed in this section is published in \citep{Borrill2016}. 

\section{Background.}



Describe the list of previously published expression experiments and how they can potentially be used as a framework for new experiments.  

Co-expression of homoeologus varies from triplet to triplet \citep{Pfeifer2014}
The silencing is mostly regulated by epigenetic changes as the hybridization events are recent.  \citep{Bottley2006}

\subsection{Alternative expression browsers.}
\label{exp:alternative}
%Expression experiments are done routinely in model organisms, such as arabidopsis.

To the best of my knowledge, the only alternative expression browser developed for specifically for wheat is WheatExp \citep{Pearce2015b}. 
This expression browser contains information of 6 studies from diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. 
The studies were selected to be complementary among them; " a broad study of five different tissues across multiple timepoints \citep{Choulet2014}, a study of seedling photomorphogenesis \citep{Fox2014}, a study of drought and heat stress in wheat seedlings \citep{Liu2015}, a study of wheat grain layers at a single timepoint \citep{Pearce2015}, a sen- escing leaf timecourse \citep{Pearce2014} and a timecourse of different grain tissue layers during development \citep{Pfeifer2014}".
The expression quantification is produced by aligning to the gene transcripts using BWA \citep{Li2010}, and the counts are extracted with HTSeq \citep{Anders2015}. 

The Expression Atlas from \acrshort{ebi} is a public resource that collects expression experiments of several species \citep{Petryszak2016}. 
The samples are processed automatically from the reads deposited ArrayExpress \citep{Kolesnikov2015}, containing data from microarrays and RNA-Seq.
The studies included are manually curataed and annotated with the relevant ontologies. 
As of September 2016, 202 differential and 82 base experiments had been included. 
The visualisation is designed to explore each gene individually, showing all the related ontologies and details on the expression by factor, or by pairs of factor on a heatmap. 
The quantification is calculated with HTSeq \citep{Anders2015}, from alignments produced with Tophat \citep{Ling2013}.

\subsection{Expression quantification with Kallisto.}

Differential expression experiments try to elucidate which genes change under different conditions. 
To do that, a quantification of the levels of expressions is needed. 
When using RNA-Seq, the expression analysis usually consists on: aligning the reads to the genome or transcriptome reference and; quantify the expression according to how many reads map to a region. 
However, this process usually takes around 6 hours per sample. 
Aligners such as \texttt{bwa} or \texttt{bowtie} produce a detailed alignment of each read, which is useful find polymorphisms (see Chapter \ref{yr15}) or to find novel alternative splices \citep{Trapnell2012}. 

For expression analysis only the count of how many reads with a transcript is required, calculating the best local alignment and the output of each read is unnecessary. 
\verb|Kallisto| is a tool that generates an index based on overlapping k-mers (sequences of size $k$), which are connected sequentially to represent each transcript (transcriptome de Bruijn Graph, T-DBG). 
For alternative splicings of the same gene, were some sequence overlap between transcripts, the connections produce two different sets of connections between k-mers. 
The k-mers on each read are then used to find the compatible transcripts across the T-DBG and those are counted. 
Finally, the program estimates the abundance of the transcript in the sample (Figure \ref{fig:exp:kallisto}; \citealt{Bray2016}).  


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{LitReview/Figures/kallisto.pdf}
\caption[Overview of kallisto.]{"Overview of kallisto. The input consists of a reference transcriptome and reads from an RNA-seq experiment. (a) An example of a read (in black) and three overlapping transcripts with exonic regions as shown. (b) An index is constructed by creating the transcriptome de Bruijn Graph (T-DBG) where
nodes (v1, v2, v3, ... ) are k-mers, each transcript corresponds to a colored path as shown and the path cover of the transcriptome induces a k-compatibility class for each k-mer. (c) Conceptually, the k-mers of a read are hashed (black nodes) to find the k-compatibility class of a read. (d) Skipping (black dashed lines) uses the information stored in the T-DBG to skip k-mers that are redundant because they have the same k-compatibility class. (e) The k-compatibility class of the read is determined by taking the intersection of the k-compatibility classes of its constituent k-mers" \citep{Bray2016}.}
\label{fig:exp:kallisto}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Relational databases.}
A Relational databases is a set of structured tables that have relationships between each other. 
The tables correspond to the data that is essential for the represented concept (domain).
For example, in a table representing several species, the common name and the scientific name belong to the same domain (ie name: Bread wheat; scientific name \textit{Triticum aestivum}). 
Tables in the same relational database form relationships between each other. 
Continuing with the example, an species can have several scientific studies related to them. 
The domain of a study can be formed by the accession, a title, a corresponding manuscript and the it is concerned with. The two tables can be connected by the usage of a common ID signifying the species. It is therefore common practice to create an extra column containing unique integer values, to act as connecting keys between two or more tables. Such a column is defined as the primary key of the table; although, strictly speaking, any set of columns whose combination of values is unique for each row can act as primary key. 
In our example an extra \texttt{id} column is added allowing to create a stable relationship between the \verb|Species| and the \verb|Studies| tables.
 (Figure \ref{fig:expvip:miniER}; \citealt{Codd1970}).
The tables \ref{exp:tab:species} and \ref{exp:tab:studies} have the content of their corresponding domains. 

\begin{figure}

\end{table}

\subsection{SQL.}
\gls{sql} is a common language to retrieve information from relational databases. 
\acrshort{sql} has operations to select columns and rows, join tables, group repeated values and order the results. 
Those simple operations are enough to retrieve the information between tables \citep{Oracle2014}. 
The following list shows a brief description of some commands  that can be used to build a query.  

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{SELECT <EXPRESSIONS> }]. A list of columns or an expression that will be displayed, separated by commas (\texttt{,}). To display all the columns, the \texttt{*} character  all the columns in the table. The order of the columns will be the same as the order given in this part of the command
\item[\texttt{FROM <TABLE>}]. follows the column names to add a list of tables to select from.
\item[\texttt{JOIN <TABLE> ON <EXPRESSION> }]. is used to join the table from the left side of the statement with the \texttt{<EXPRESSION>} given after the \texttt{ON} clause.  
\item[\texttt{WHERE <EXPRESSION>}] filters the rows by the \texttt{<EXPRESSION>}
\item[\texttt{ORDER BY <COLUMNS>}]. The rows will be sorted by the natural order of the given \texttt{<COLUMNS>}.  
\item[\texttt{GROUP BY <COLUMNS>}]. The rows are merged by the columns stated. This can be used to get an unique set of values and apply a function to all the rows that have the same value, as a count.
\end{description} 

Expressions can be values, operators or functions like:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{COLUMN}] The value of a column. 
\item[ \texttt{<EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>}] \texttt{TRUE} when the left and right \texttt{<EXPRESSION>} are equal. \texttt{FALSE} otherwise 
\item[ \texttt{<EXPRESSION> > <EXPRESSION>}] \texttt{TRUE} when the left  \texttt{<EXPRESSION>} is greater than the  right \texttt{<EXPRESSION>} are equal. \texttt{FALSE} otherwise 
\item[ \texttt{<EXPRESSION> < <EXPRESSION>}] \texttt{TRUE} when the left  \texttt{<EXPRESSION>} is less than the  right \texttt{<EXPRESSION>} are equal. \texttt{FALSE} otherwise
\item[ \texttt{COUNT(*)}] The count of rows that have the same values, as selected in the \texttt{GROUP BY} clause.
\end{description}

A simple query to join the  \texttt{species} and \texttt{studies} tables and displaying only the species name, scientific name and accession of the study is shown in Listing \ref{exp:lst:joinExample}. 
The results of the query are in Table \ref{exp:tab:joinExample}. 

\begin{code}[language=sql, label=exp:lst:joinExample,caption=Join example query]
SELECT 
	species.name, 
	species.scientific_name, 
	studies.accession, 
FROM species
JOIN studies on species.id = studies.species_id;
\end{code}

\begin{table}[h!]

\caption[Join example]{Join of the \texttt{species} and \texttt{studies} table. }
\label{exp:tab:joinExample}
\centering
\input{expVIP/tables/studiesAndSpecies}
\end{table}


The relationships between tables can be of the following types:

\begin{description}
\item[one-to-one.] When rows on a table can be related to a row in a second table. On the diagrams they are represented by a straight line.
\item[many-to-many.] Rows on a table can have many corresponding rows in a second table, resented with lines with whiskers on both sides of the line.  
\item[one-to-many.] Rows on a table can be related to many rows on the second table, represented with whiskers only on one side of the line. 
\end{description}

An important feature of a database is the ability to store the 
data consistently.
A transaction is a set of related operations that need to be performed at the same time; as such, it needs to follow the principles of \gls{acid} \citep{Haerder1983}.


\begin{description}
\item[Atomicity.] All the operation or none have to be performed. If any of them fails or an error happens while the transaction is executed the data has to be restored to the original status. 
\item[Consistency.] The changes in the database have to be valid before and after the transaction. 
\item[Isolation.] If more than one transaction is being executed at the same time, the result must be the same as if the transactions were executed one after the other. 
\item[Durability.] The result of the transaction is stored even if the server is restarted.
\end{description}  

\unsure{Add explanaiton of inserts. }

Several \gls{rdbms} implement \acrshort{sql}, with various levels of compliance to the standard and different licenses.  
A popular \acrshort{rdbms} is \texttt{MySQL}.
From the beginning \texttt{MySQL} aimed to be a lightweight and easy to install open source product \citep{Oracle2014}. 
This characteristics made it popular on the web and it is currently the \gls{rdbms} behind ensembl! \citep{Flicek2012}. 

\subsection{Model-View-Controller}

\begin{SCfigure} 
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{LitReview/Figures/MVC.pdf}
  \caption{\acrshort{mvc} interaction between components.}
  \label{fig:poly:mvc}
\end{SCfigure}
The \gls{mvc} is a metaphor to isolate the user interactions from the underlying data. 
The models hold the data on logical their domains.
The views contain the layout on how the models are displayed to the user.
The controllers receive the requests from the users and modify the models hold the data as mapped to their logical domains accordingly and send a view back for display. 
The \acrshort{mvc} metaphor allows the development of independent parts of the system and helps to structure the underlying representation of the domains.  (Figure \ref{fig:poly:mvc}; \citealt{Krasner1988}).

\gls{ror} is a framework to develop web applications heavily influenced by the \acrshort{mvc} metaphor. 
It is based on the Rails language and provides several tasks designed to facilitate the development, such as automated tasks designed to create models with their corresponding views and controllers. 
On the top of that, it provides the tools to manage the connection and queries to the \acrshort{rdbms}, allowing the developer to focus on the functionality \citep{RailsGuide2016}. 

\subsection{Data visualisation}

In the last couple of decades the amount of information available to any given field has been growing exponentially, in part thanks to the internet. 
The challenge is to produce tools that help the interpretation of data. 
An effective way to communicate large amount of data is trough visualisation, but it has to have the following properties to be usable \citep{Myatt2011}.

\begin{description}
\item[Time to learn.] The user needs to take little time to learn how to use the system to extract the information they need. Also, all the features should be easy to find.
\item[Performance.] The tool needs to be quick to access and transform the visualisation as the user requests.
\item[Accuracy.] The tool has to perform as the user expects, so if the tool is prone to make users commit mistakes, it is not accurate. 
\item[Memorability.] Once the user learns to use the system, is it easy remember how to use it? Systems that change their interface often, or between windows are not as easy to remember. 
\item[Satisfaction.] The user responds positively to the use of the system and the time is spent actually exploring the data, and not trying to make the system work. 
\end{description}

\subsection{Aims}

The aims of expVIP are to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Integrate RNA-Seq experiments from several sources in a single database (Section \ref{exp:DB}). 
\item Automate the calculation of the expression values and load them in to the database (Section \ref{exp:pipeline}).
\item Produce a usable visualisation for said expression values (Section \ref{exp:gui}).
\item Make the system available to the community (Section \ref{exp:gui}).
\end{enumerate}


\section{General design}

One of the main objectives of expVIP is to make the public expression datasets easily accessible and explorable for the target community to the target community (currently wheat, but not limited to it). 
A web interface is an effective way to reach a global audience. 
A web service requires to have a server to run the application and a browser to connect to the server and display it (ie Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox).
The web server technology used for expVIP is \acrshort{ror}, as it abstracts the \acrshort{mvc} metaphor and it is designed to speed the development \citep{RailsGuide2016}. 
In order to display the expression data to the users,  expVIP relies on a BioJS component (\citealt{Yachdav2015}, Section \ref{exp:gui}) developed for expVIP. 
All the data is stored in a MySQL database (Section \ref{exp:DB}) and it is accessed trough models developed under  \acrshort{ror} (Figure \ref{fig:poly:archDesign}).  

\begin{SCfigure} 
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{expVIP/Figures/archDesign.pdf}
  \caption{General design of expVIP}
  \label{fig:poly:archDesign}
\end{SCfigure}

\section{Database design} 
\label{exp:DB}

To address the different types of conditions over different experiments, expVIP is designed around a relational database. 
The design comprises of two core groups of tables and two auxiliary tables that take care of different species and  homoeologues and (Figure \ref{fig:expvip:dbDesign}).


\begin{sidewaysfigure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{expVIP/Figures/dbDesign.pdf}
\caption[expVIP database design]{Database design. The block on the top stores the meta-data about the experiments and the studies. The bottom block consist on the tables related to the expression values. Species and homoeologues are outside the main blocks as they are not core to the groups. The whiskers in the connections show the cardinality of the relationships.  }
\label{fig:expvip:dbDesign}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\begin{description}
\item[Metadata] The tables in this group contain the information of each one of the studies. 
\begin{description}
\item[Studies] Contains the general information of a study, which contain several experiments. The table also contains the reference to the paper where the data is published and the accession for the study. 
\item[Experiment group] keeps together all the individual experiments that come from the same study and that were taken on the same condition (ie. replicates). 
\item[Factors] holds all the possible factors used to group the experiments. Each experiment group has many factors and each factor group has many experiment groups. As the experiment doesn't have a fixed number of column representing each factor, it is possible to have any arbitrary number factors to group. 
\item[Experiment] holds the information of each individual experiment, with the corresponding accession. 
\end{description}
\item[Expression values.] The tables on this block contain the expression of each gene and the information for the genes. 
\begin{description}
\item[Types of value] keeps a list of different units that are stored. On the original design \acrshort{tpm} and raw counts are set up, but as the units are not hard coded it is possible to use \acrshort{fpkm}, \acrshort{rpkm} or any other unit. 
\item[Gene Set] contains the name of a reference gene set for the analysis. On the original version of expVIP, the gene models from the \acrshort{iwgsc} as deposited in Ensembl release 26 were used \citep{Mayer2014} However, the use of this table enables the use of several reference gene models on the same database. 
\item[Genes] are related to a \texttt{gene set}, so even if they have the same name coming from different datasets it is possible to distinguish them. This situation is unlikely to occur when using published references, but when joining several \textit{de Novo} gene models. 
\item[Meta Experiment] allows to have the same data analysed with different tools. By default expVIP uses Kallisto \citep{Bray2016}. However other tools, or different versions of the same tool, can be used to repeat the analysis.   
\item[Values] have a domain that includes the \texttt{meta experiment}, \texttt{gene} and, \texttt{type of value}.
\end{description}
\item[Homoeologues] contains the relationship between genes. This allows to get the expression values of several related genes. 
\item[Species] contains the target species of a study. It is not linked to the gene models to allow the direct comparison between related species using the same gene models (ie, \texttt{T. aestivum} vs \texttt{T. turgidum}). 
\end{description}

In the cases where a relationship between tables is not unique, such as \texttt{experiment\_groups} having many \texttt{factors} and the \texttt{factors} having many \texttt{experiment\_groups}, storing of relationships is done with an auxiliary table (ie. \texttt{ExperimentGroups\_Factors}, not explicitly shown in Figure \ref{fig:expvip:dbDesign}, but implicit by the lines with whiskers). 

Once all the data is stored, the tables can be queried together to make clear the relationship between specific rows. 
One of the core tasks of expVIP is to get all the factors that define each experiment, in order to be able to merge similar studies. 
To retrieve the \texttt{experiments} and \texttt{factors} of an \texttt{experiment group}, the auxiliary tables \texttt{ExperimentGroups\_Factors}  and \texttt{experiment\_groups\_experiments} are used in the query. (Listing \ref{lst:exp:queryMetadata} and Table \ref{tab:exp:queryMetadata}).


\begin{code}[language=sql, caption={[Query experiments and factors]Query experiments and factorsQuery experiments and factors from accession 'DRR003148'},label=lst:exp:queryMetadata]
SELECT
	experiments.accession,  
	factors.factor,
	factors.description, 
	experiment_groups.name as expriment_group 
FROM factors 
JOIN ExperimentGroups_Factors 
	ON factors.id = ExperimentGroups_Factors.factor_id
JOIN experiment_groups 
	ON experiment_groups.id = ExperimentGroups_Factors.experiment_group_id
JOIN experiment_groups_experiments 
	ON experiment_groups_experiments.experiment_group_id = experiment_groups.id
JOIN experiments 
	ON experiments.id = experiment_groups_experiments.experiment_id
WHERE accession =  'DRR003148'
\end{code}

%\pagebreak

\label{tab:exp:queryMetadata}
\input{expVIP/tables/metadataDRR003148}
\end{table}

Likewise, to get the \texttt{expression\_values} for a \texttt{gene} with the corresponding unit (\texttt{type\_of\_values}) and \texttt{experiment} a simple query joining the four tables is used. 
The Listing \ref{lst:exp:queryExpValues} retrieves the \texttt{expression\_values} for the \texttt{gene} 'Traes\_5BS\_0AFC3F795.1', and the result is on Listing \ref{tab:exp:queryExpValues}

\begin{code}[language=sql, caption={[Query values for gene and experiment group] Query values from 'Group1' and gene 'Traes\_5BS\_0AFC3F795.1' },label=lst:exp:queryExpValues]
SELECT 
	genes.name as gene, 
	expression_values.value,
	experiments.accession,
	type_of_values.name as unit
FROM expression_values
JOIN genes 
	ON expression_values.gene_id = genes.id
JOIN type_of_values 
	ON type_of_values.id = expression_values.type_of_value_id
JOIN experiments 
	ON experiments.id = expression_values.experiment_id
WHERE 
	genes.name = 'Traes_5BS_0AFC3F795.1' 
\end{code}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption[Results of query for values]{Results of query to get the values for gene 'Traes\_5BS\_0AFC3F795.1' (Listing \ref{lst:exp:queryExpValues}), only 'Group1' is displayed from the output.}
\label{tab:exp:queryExpValues}
\input{expVIP/tables/valuesGroup1GeneTraes_5BS_0AFC3F795.1}
\end{table}

With those two queries is enough to retrieve all the information required to do sub-groupings. 

The database is implemented using the \acrshort{rdbms} \texttt{MySQL 5.5}. 



\section{Data integration pipeline} 
\label{exp:pipeline}


To prepare the database, expVIP requires to have all the metadata for the experiments to integrate. 
ExpVIP contains tasks to load all the metadata and a wrapper for Kallisto that can be run from expVIP. 
Alternatively, the expression values can be calculated with another tool and loaded as a single file, this approach is preferred for a large set of samples (Figure \ref{fig:exp:loadPipeline}). 
Details on how to load the files in the database are in the expVIP tutorial (Appendix \ref{exp:tutorial}). 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{expVIP/Figures/loadDataPipeline.pdf}
\caption[expVIP load data]{The pipeline for loading the data into expVIP. The black lines represent a border of tasks that are not required to be executed in a particular order.}
\label{fig:exp:loadPipeline}
\end{figure}

The required files for the metadata are:
\begin{description}
\item[Factors.] The file contains all the possible factors that can be used to group all the experiments. The file must contain the following columns (Table \ref{tab:exp:factors}):
\begin{description}
\item[factor] The category were the factor belongs. In the case of the initial dataset used in expVIP, the grouping factors are: Age, stress-disease, tissue and, a corresponding 'High level' for each factor. The metadata file must contain a cloumn corresponding to each one of this factors. 
\item[order] The default order in which to display each factor. This ensures that the age of the plants are sorted chronologically. 
\item[name] Long description of each level for the category. The values in this column must match the values in the metadata file (see below).   
\item[short] Is a short name, used when the space to display the full description of the factor is not enough.
\end{description}
\begin{table}
\centering
\caption[Factors file]{Factors file. The table must be saved as a text file, with columns separated by tabs}
\label{tab:exp:factors}
\begin{tabular}{llll}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\item[metadata] The metadata file is the file that contains the information related to each study and the corresponding experiments. 
Each study contains several experiment groups (replicates), which in turn contain every individual experiment. 
The factors must be shared across experimental groups. 
\begin{description}
\item[secondary\_study\_accession] The accession number for experiments carried as part of a single study. This is usually the high level BioProject or SRA number. 
\item[run\_accession] The accession of the individual run. 
\item[scientific\_name] of the species. 
\item[experiment\_title] A description for the individual RNA-seq sample.
\item[study\_title] A description of the general study.
\item[Manuscript] The DOI of the study.
\item[Group\_for\_averaging] A description of the experiment. This must be the same all the replicates in the same study. 
\item[Group\_number\_for\_averaging] A short name for replicated experiments.  
\item[Total reads] (optional)
\item[Mapped reads] (optional)
\end{description}
Besides the main fields, each factor has a a corresponding column Variety, Tissue,Age, Stress-disease, High level variety, High level tissue, High level age and, High level stress-disease

\item[Gene set] The gene set is provided as a single fasta file. 
The file may contain alternative transcripts from the same gene. To identify this, the fasta header may include the optional fields \texttt{gene} and \texttt{transcript}. 
On the absence of this, the only stored value is the name from the \textgreater  character to the first space (Listing \ref{lst:poly:geneFa}). 

\begin{code}[label=lst:poly:geneFa, caption={[Gene set fasta file] A fasta entry on of the gene set.}]

\end{code}
\item[homoeologues] A file containing the homoeologues for the  A, B and D genomes. Currently these are the only supported default names. The file also include a column with the gene name and to which Group (ie 1, 2, 3 ... 7) and Genome (ie A, B or D) it belongs (Table \ref{tab:exp:hom}).

\bottomrule 
\end{tabular}
\end{sidewaystable}
\end{description} 

expVIP includes several tasks to load the different files. 
For example, to load the factors the \verb|load_data:factor| starts a transaction (Listing \ref{lst:exp:laodFactor}; line 2) to ensure that all the data is loaded, and if for some reason the load fails, the database is restored to the previous status.
In the transaction, the file is open with the \verb|csv| library row by row (line 3).
The function \verb|find_or_create_by| is a function that \acrshort{ror} provides on models to create an entry in the table, or update it if already exists.
Each row is used to create or update a \verb|Factor| (lines 374-376). 
A similar strategy is used for all the files that are regular tables. 

\begin{code}[language=ruby, caption={[Load factors]Task that loads factors}, label=lst:exp:laodFactor]
task :factor, [:filename] => :environment do |t, args|
  ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do 
    CSV.foreach(args[:filename], :headers => true, :col_sep => "\t") do |row|
      factor = Factor.find_or_create_by(:factor=>row["factor"],  :description=>row["name"],  :name=>row["short"])
      factor.order = row["order"].to_i
      factor.save!
    end
  end
end
\end{code}

The gene sets are loaded slightly differently, as the input is a \verb|fasta| file, as opposed to tabular file. 
The reader for the \verb|FastaFormat| from BioRuby \citep{Goto2010} is used to read the file (Listing \ref{lst:exp:loadGenes}; line 4). 
Since expVIP only records the name of the genes, only the id of the fasta sequence is extracted (lines 6-79). 
The name is stored in the name and cDNA columns. 
The parser for entries from ensembl, such the one in Listing \ref{lst:poly:geneFa} include code to load the \acrshort{cdna} and transcript fields correctly. 

\begin{code}[language=ruby, caption={[Load genes from Fasta]Task that load genes from a Fasta File}, label=lst:exp:loadGenes]
task :de_novo_genes, [:gene_set,:filename] => :environment do |t, args|
  ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
    gene_set = GeneSet.find_or_create_by(:name=>args[:gene_set])
    Bio::FlatFile.open(Bio::FastaFormat, args[:filename]) do |ff|
      ff.each do |entry| 
        arr = entry.definition.split(/\s+/)
        name = arr[0]
        g = Gene.new 
        g.gene_set = gene_set
        g.name = name
        g.cdna = name
        g.save!
      end
    end
  end
end
\end{code}

There are two options to load the expression values from the database: a matrix with all the expression values and running \verb|Kallisto| from expVIP. 

The task in Listing \ref{lst:exp:loadValues} loads the expression values from a tabular file with the genes as rows and the values as columns. 
The exception handling and messages are removed 
The task requires the following arguments:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{meta\_experiment}.] A name for the analysis. This can be the name of the tool used for the expression quantification combined with the name of the reference, as a single text variable. 
\item[\texttt{gene\_set}.] The reference used for the analysis. 
\item[\texttt{value\_type}.] The unit of the file (ie.  \acrshort{tpm}, count)
\item[\texttt{filename}.] The file that is going to be loaded in the database. 
\end{description}

The steps to load the values are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A trasaction is initiated at the begining of the task, to ensure that if any step fails and the execution is aborted the database will stay in a consistent state (Listing \ref{lst:exp:loadValues}; line 2).
\item The connection is assigned to the variable \verb|conn|, to be able to execute queries directly to the database (line 3).   
\item The \verb|meta_experimet|, \verb|gene_set| and \verb|value_type| are loaded and stored to get the corresponding IDs in the insertion (line 4).
\item All the \verb|Genes| and \verb|Experiments| are loaded in their corresponding hash table, to be able to get the IDs when the actual values are inserted (lines 7-11). 
\item The file is read with the \verb|CSV| library from Ruby, keeping the headers to be able to assign the correct experiment (line 14). 
\item The first column is named \verb|target_id| and contains the gene name. The ID of the gene  in the database is retrieved from the previously loaded hash (lines 15-16)
\item Each column is iterated and the values needed to execute the insertion to the database are concatenated. 
\item Whenever the number of queued insertions reaches 1,000, the command to perform the insertions is executed (line 25). 
\item As the number of genes is not usually a multiple of 1,000, when the process finished reading the file an extra insertion is executed to empty the queue (line 30).
\end{enumerate}

The decision to execute the insertions in batches of 1,000 objects is to reduce the number of processes running in the database, while keeping low the memory usage of the application. 
This approach is faster than using the functions for insertions \acrshort{ror} on multiple values. 
For trivial operations, the functions from the framework are used, as they are easier to maintain (compare insertion in line 4 to the block of code from line 18 to 26). 

\begin{code}[language=ruby, label=lst:exp:loadValues, caption={[Load expression values from file] Task to load the expression values from a tabular file.}]
task :values, [:meta_experiment, :gene_set, :value_type, :filename ] => :environment do |t, args| 
ActiveRecord::Base::transaction do
conn = ActiveRecord::Base.connection
meta_exp = MetaExperiment.find_or_create_by(:name=>args[:meta_experiment])
gene_set = GeneSet.find_by(:name=>args[:gene_set])
value_type = TypeOfValue.find_or_create_by(:name=>args[:value_type])
experiments = Hash.new
meta_exp.gene_set = gene_set
genes = Hash.new
Gene.find_by_sql("SELECT * FROM genes where gene_set_id='#{gene_set.id}'").each {|g| { genes[g.name] = g.id}
Experiment.find_each{|e| experiments[e.accession] = e.id}
count = 0
inserts = Array.new
CSV.foreach(args[:filename], :headers => true, :col_sep => "\t") do |row|
	gene_name = row["target_id"]
	gene = genes[gene_name]
	row.delete("target_id")
	row.to_hash.each_pair do |name, val| 
		val = val.to_f 
		str = "(#{experiments[name]},#{gene},#{meta_exp.id},#{value_type.id},#{val},NOW(),NOW())"
		inserts.push str          
	end
	count += 1
	if count % 1000 == 0 
		sql = "INSERT INTO expression_values (`experiment_id`,`gene_id`, `meta_experiment_id`, `type_of_value_id`, `value`,`created_at`, `updated_at`) VALUES #{inserts.join(", ")}"
		conn.execute sql
		inserts = Array.new
	end
end
sql = "INSERT INTO expression_values (`experiment_id`,`gene_id`, `meta_experiment_id`, `type_of_value_id`, `value`,`created_at`, `updated_at`) VALUES #{inserts.join(", ")}"
conn.execute sql
end
end
\end{code}

\end{wrapfigure}

Alternatively, expVIP can execute kallisto on all the samples loaded in the database. 
To this purpose, expVIP stores the raw reads in fastq format, organized in directories named with the same accessions as in the metadata (ie a directory named \verb|DRR003148| contains the reads for the metadata displayed in table \ref{tab:exp:queryMetadata}). 
expVIP takes all the accessions for the experiments in the database and searches for the corresponding folder. 
If the folder exists and if it contains the \verb|fastq| files, then it is deemed as valid. 
If the folder already has the \verb|kallisto| output, the next folder is evaluated, otherwise \verb|kallisto| is executed with its default settings and the results are loaded into the database. 
This process is repeated for all the accessions (Figure \ref{fig:exp:runKallisto}).  
This pipeline allows to populate the database partially, in case that not all the experiments are ready from the beginning. 

New experiments can be added to the existing metadata file  or to a new file; the expVIP loading procedure then can be run again to update the list of experiments and the corresponding expression values. 
This design allows to keep the database updated as more experiments become available. 
The fact that the loading is done in transactions ensures that the database is kept consistent, regardless of potential errors in the input files. 

\section{Graphical interface}
\label{exp:gui}  
%How the expression can be displayed filtered, and sorted
With the expression across experiments integrated in a single database, the next challenge is to make the data accessible to a wide audience. 
\acrshort{ror} has tasks to automate the construction of controllers and views from the \acrshort{mvc} metaphor, helping on the retrieval and formatting of the raw data. 
However, the main objective was to visualise the data from all the experiments as intuitively as possible. 
To make the visualisation dynamic in a browser, the use of \verb|JavaScript| is necessary, as it is the only widely adopted programming language used for web content. 
Among the tools built on the top of \verb|JavaScript|, \verb|D3| is a framework designed explicitly to do dynamic visualisations \citep{Bostock2011}. 

Usability was a top priority on the design of the visualisation component for expVIP. 
The time needed to learn, performance are accuracy were taken into account when designing expVIP. 
As memorability and satisfaction are subjective, they were not directly tested for during development.  


\begin{description}
\item[Time to learn.] The controls are located in two blocks, one for global controls (ie. unit, save plot) and one to modify the factors, close to the factor they affect (Figure \ref{fig:exp:layout}). 
\item[Performance.] All the data for the genes being displayed is loaded from the database in a single transaction. The data is available in the cache of web browser and whenever the user changes anything in the visualisation, new values are calculated locally. 
\item[Accuracy.] As knowing what the users will do is not obvious, the visualisation was given to a panel of potential users (other members of the Uauy lab) for comments. In previous versions the legends were a confusing and the location of the buttons was too distant from the aspect of visualisation that they controlled. After reviewing the feedback, the accuracy was improved.  Also, the position of the controls don't change, regardless of the representation of the data (bar plot or heatmap).

\end{figure}

The elements in the graphical are shown in Figures \ref{fig:exp:tutorial1}, \ref{fig:exp:tutorial2} and \ref{fig:exp:tutorial3}, with a description of each element of the \acrshort{gui} listed below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Search box!}: at any point it is possible to type a new gene name (based on Ensembl Plants nomenclature) and generate a new set of expression data.
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Compare box!}: it is possible to add a second gene and press the \lstinline!Compare! button to generate two expression graphs drawn at the same scale.
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Menu options!}: has several links on the details of the study and tutorial. The menu can be edited to customize instances of expVIP. 
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Gene!}: shows the currently displayed gene, with a link to Ensembl to the corresponding description. 
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Expression unit!}: selects the expression unit to visualise. This can be either \gls{tpm} or  estimated counts. If other units are loaded in the database, they will appear in this field. 
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Save graph!}: these two buttons allow users to save the current graphs in either \lstinline!SVG! (to work on Adobe Ilustrator) or as \lstinline!PNG! files. 
  The export process selects the graphical elements from the visualization and binds them together on a single \verb|SVG| file. The reasons to follow this process are: to ensure that the plot reflects the user selection; remove the elements that do not have a meaning in a static context and; allow the user to format the image with publication quality (Figure \ref{fig:exp:exportImage}).

\end{figure}

\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Save data!}: downloads a \lstinline!csv! file with the data with the current selection and
  order of factors as displayed on the screen. The data will include the standard errors and the number of samples that make up each value. 
  An example of how the output looks is in Listing \ref{lst:exp:exportSample}. 


\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Homoeologues!}: this button displays the
 graphs of known homoeologues of the original primary gene. This gene is highlighted in bold and the homoeologous graphs will be displayed according to A, B, D genome ordering. 
 The scale of all the homoeologues is the same to facilitate the comparison between them. 
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Gene names!}: each displayed gene is labelled on this block.  
  If the list of genes is too long, the gene names are rotated for readability. 
  In case that a gene name is too long to fit, the font is scaled to the largest size that will fit in the designated area. 
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Expression level!}: the expression level adjusts according to the expression of each set of gene homoeologues. The scale remains consistent across homoeologues to allow comparison. 
  The values are based on the unit selected in the \lstinline!expression unit! box (see point 5 above).

\begin{figure}

\caption{Features on expVIP (continued)}
\label{fig:exp:tutorial2}
\end{figure}

\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Filter!}: opens a pop-up window revealing the levels of the selected category. 
  By default, all the levels are selected, but the users can decide to exclude from the visualisation experiments containing any level. 
  The order of the levels can be modified by dragging the levels on the the pop-up window. 
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Display/hide category!}: Each category
  can be displayed or hidden by pressing the \lstinline!+/-! button.
  As categories are added or removed the expression graphs show the new values for the new groups. 
  Data is not removed when changing the displayed categories, instead the values are distributed according to the new groups (the number of samples remains the same). 
  The colours below the category correspond to each level, and the plot is coloured according to the sorting category. 
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Expression bars!}: These bars represent the expression level for the \verb|n| grouped samples according to
  the chosen categories (11 and 12 above).
  When hovering over the bar with the mouse a small tooltip will appear, containing the expression level (\lstinline!tpm! or \lstinline!counts!) and the standard error (sem) used for the error bars (see 14)
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Error bars!}: Standard error of the means for the \verb|n| expression values on which the bar graph is based.
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Factors!}: The colour of the rectangles represents the displayed categories, according to the selection criteria (11 and 12 above). 
  To clarify the meaning of the colour, hovering above the rectangle displays a tooltip with the long name of the examined level. 
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Description!}: Textual description of the grouped factors, according to the selection criteria (11 and 12 above). 
  The number of grouped samples is also displayed.

\caption{Features on expVIP for Multiple gene comparisons}
\label{fig:exp:tutorial3}
\end{figure}

\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Expression unit!}: For heatmaps, the default unit log2(tpm) as the logarithmic scale provides a better context for comparisons acorss several genes.
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Heatmap!}: To compare several genes, the values are represented as a heatmap. The sorting and filtering is done with the same controls as for single genes.
  Up to 50 genes are displayed in the heatmap, as more genes will degrade the performance of the database, and the visual clutter makes the plot hard to interpret. 
  This view allows to visualise several candidate genes for a trait expressed under certain conditions and quickly asses which one is a good candidate for further research. 
\item
  \textbf{\lstinline!Scale!}: The scale is calculated according to the highest displaued value in the current heatmap. 
  Since logarithmic values below 1 result in negative values and anything with a \acrshort{tpm} under 2 is considered as very low expressed, every value lower than 1 is plotted as 0.

\section{Discussion.} 


The use of previously published studies is a valuable resource. 

When I started the development of expVIP none of the expression browsers mentioned in Section \ref{exp:alternative} had data for wheat. 


WheatExp was developed roughly at the same time of expVIP and it contains studies 6 studies (against 16 on expVIP; \citealt{Pearce2015b}). 
Four of the studies in WheatExp are on hexaploid wheat and are included in expVIP. 
In WheatExp, the expression for each gene is displayed on the context of the original experiment without a direct comparison between studies. 
However, because the studies are kept independently the levels of the categories are a direct reflection of the original studies. 
WheatExp allows to search genes by sequence, a feature not implemented in expVIP. 

The Expression Atlas from \acrshort{ebi} has a more comprehensive list of experiments than WheatExp, most of them from 2016 \citep{Petryszak2016}. 
ExpVIP contains studies released before \acrshort{ebi} started to upload expression experiments for wheat. 
However, some of the most recent studies in the Expression Atlas are not included in expVIP yet, however we are in the process of updating expVIP to include studies published after the initial release.
In terms of visualisation, the \acrshort{ebi} included a heatmap to compare to different factors at the same time for given gene (ie. tissue vs stress), the same information can be displayed on expVIP by sorting by two factors.

Some features that could improve expVIP in the long term, already present in other expression browsers like searching by sequence, by gene ontology and, a heatmap of a particular gene displaying two different factors on each axis . 
A feature that could leverage from other genomic resources is the retrival of genes flanking a gene of interest, or between genetic markers. 
The upcoming assemblies , from the IWGSC \citep{Clark2016} and TGACv1 \citep{Pozniak2016}  with longer scaffolds in conjunction with the high resolution genetic maps from \citet{Wang2014} and \citet{Chapman2015} can enable such kind of queries (resources described in Section \ref{lit:wheatResourcers}). 




Advantages of storing and making accessible the information of the homoeologues. 

Potential to use expVIP to comapre between species. 

Use TPM instead of RPKM

Stats of how many users have used expVIP

%Also, mention that despite the fact that there are several expression/gene browsers, none of them allow comparisons between species and don't consider polyploids. 

%We have not provided RPKM given the
%  inconsistencies generated across samples when using this measure. A
%  detailed discussion can be found in \citep{}
%  \href{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22872506}{Wagner \emph{et
%  al}} (2012). It is important to mention that \lstinline!tpm! is
%  preferred over RPKM since it allows an easier comparison for
%  abundances between samples. However it is important to stress that
%  while \lstinline!tpm! serves as a relative measure to compare genes
%  across experiments, a proper normalisation and statistical analysis
%  with differential gene expression programs must be performed.
%  \lstinline!expVIP! generates outputs which allow easy implementation
%  of \lstinline!sleuth!, \lstinline!DESeq! and \lstinline!EdgeR!.

%Things to do: add comparassions between corresponding genes between species

For the TGACv1 assembly an updated annotation has been released, and the \acrshort{iwgsc} will provide an updated annotation for their genome too. 
In the near future, expVIP will be updated to include those annotations and some development will be needed to allow the comparison between annotations, at least while the community adopts a canonical reference. 

The same mechanisms to compare expression between different references can be used to compare the expression between different organisms. 
That will enable to find conserved patterns across species in the same family. 
For example,
