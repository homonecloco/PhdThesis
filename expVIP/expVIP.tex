\chapter{Gene expression (expVIP)}

\section{Expression experiments (Introduction)} 
Describe the list of previously published expression experiments and how they can potentially be used as a framework for new experiments.  

\section{Database design} 
Description of how the database was designed and the flexibility given by having the factors and units as variables

\section{Analysis pipeline} 
Implementation of the pipeline, from running kallisto to load the data in the database 

\section{Graphical interface}  
How the expression can be displayed filtered, and sorted

\section{Conclusions} 
The use of previously published studies is a valuable resource. Also, mention that despite the fact that there are several expression/gene browsers, none of them allow comparisons between species and don't consider polyploids.
