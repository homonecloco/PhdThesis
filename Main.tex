	# \textbf{Gene expression (expVIP)}  
	
	# \textbf{Conclusions and final remarks} This section wraps up by showing the relationship and importance of a comprehensive approach to data analysis, from the field, genetics, molecular biology and genomics. I will also remark how the technology and the resources have changed in the last 4 years. As at the references used at beginning where superseded during the PhD.
