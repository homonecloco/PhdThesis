This PhD could not have been possible with the support of my family, friends and colleagues. 

First, I would like to thank my supervisors, Mario Caccamo and Cristobal Uauy for their unconditional support, regardless the circumstances. 
They had been good at nurturing my curiosity with all this "just one week projects" that end up thesis chapters, peer review articles or just a lot of fun in the process of learning how not to do things. 
I must thank them also for their trust on me, even when I haven't been sure of my own capacity.

I would like to thank my family for their unconditional support. 
On the distance, we remain together. 

I am extremely grateful to Esther, Luca and Evanthia who shoed a lot of filotimo when proofreading and giving feedback in very short notice, without even being asked. 

If I am sure I am missing some old an new friends that had given light in this four years, to all of you: Thanks. 

Finally, I want to dedicate this thesis to the loving memory of my grandparents who left this world just a few months before giving them the joy witnessing the completion of this PhD.
