\chapter{General discussion and final remarks}
This section wraps up by showing the relationship and importance of a comprehensive approach to data analysis, from the field, genetics, molecular biology and genomics. I will also remark how the technology and the resources have changed in the last 4 years. As at the references used at beginning where superseded during the PhD. 


Biology is becoming interdisciplinary

Knowledge from  computer science can be applied to produce software for specific needs, but useful for the comunity

Polyploidy has an extra level of complexity (due to homoeologues), but with the current developments of technology is possible to start getting around them. 

Future project: PolyInDel. 

In the case of wheat, new resources had been coming out year after year, and each one helps to put everything in to a context. 

It is more likely to get relevant results in a more effective way using the latest developments.
