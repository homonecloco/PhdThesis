\chapter{PolyMarker: A fast polyploid primer design pipeline}
\section{Introduction} 
%Explain how the SNP markers are designed without the tool and an overview. 
One of the main challenges of working with polyploid species is de design of genome specific molecular markers. 
This is particularly true when targetting conserved homoeologues regions, where a primer could bind to a pair,or triplet, of identical sequences. 
For that reason, designing primers for polyploids require to include bases that are specific to the target, in addition to the physico-chemical properties of the primer.  
The traditional methodology to find primer candidates include a blast search and a local alignment, select the primer candidates manually, and finally, validate the primers with a tool, like Primer3\cite{Rozen}. 
To reduce the time invested in designed primers I have developed PolyMarker \cite{Ramirez-Gonzalez2015a}, a pipeline to automate the primere design in polyploids.

\section{Global alignment} 
Search of the contigs with the sequence in the CSS reference and the importance of being able to distinguish between homoeologous regions.

\section{Local alignment} 
Once the region with the primer has been selected, make a local alignment. This section discusses why the local alignment is needed. 

\section{Primer design tools} 
In this section, the principles of \textit{in silico} primer design are discussed, and why not simply selecting a genomic variation is enough (thermal stability, primers folding on themselves)

\section{Primer selection algorithms} 
Different algorithms to select the \"best primer\". 

\subsection{KASP markers} 
For KASP markers, the product should be as short as possible with the mutation in the first three bases. 

\section{Designed markers} Details of the generated primers for the 80k iSelect chip and the 820k axiom chip. This section also include counts on how many are genome specific, semi-specific and non specific. Also an analysis of how many are repeated or map to more than one chromosome perfectly.

\subsection{Regular markers}  
PolyMarker was designed for KASP assays, but it was later extended to produce regular primers, where both primers start with a genome-specific base. This simplifies the design of primers for regular PCR and capillary sequencing. 




\subsection{Deletion algorithms}
Algorithm to produce KASP for deletions in polyploids.

\section{Conclusions} Remarks on the importance of getting the primers right, and the time saved by automating the primer selection. Also mention other primer design tools that have been inspired by polymarker: \cite{Ma2015}, \cite{Wang2016}

PolyMarker has been used succesfully to design genome-specific primers in several projects.
